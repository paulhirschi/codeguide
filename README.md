# Code Guide
**For the Grant Victor Front-End**

*Standards for developing Sustainable and Flexible HTML & CSS*

The goal is to standardize the implementation of HTML & CSS.  Every line of code should appear as if written by a single person.

CSS & Sass guidelines are a mixture of what I believe are the best parts of [BEM](https://en.bem.info/), [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/), [DoCSSa](http://docssa.info/),  and [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/).

*Future Roadmap*
* Include an [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org) file for easy adaptation across different text editors.
